# Mindustry Logic

Mindustry logic highlighting + C to MLOG compiler

## Features

### Highlighting

Highlights MLOG in the editor.

Semantic highlighting __must__ be enabled, it enables this for the language by default so you'd have to go out of your way to disable it but it does need enabled for this to work.

### Compilation

Compiles C to MLOG using a modified version of [c2logic](https://github.com/SuperStormer/c2logic)



## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (does not support windows py launcher as of now)
- pycparser (`pip install pycparser` or `pip3 install pycparser`)

## Known Issues

## License

Apache 2.0 (see `LICENSE` for details)
